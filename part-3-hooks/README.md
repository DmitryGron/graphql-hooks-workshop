# Part 3 - graphQL-hooks

- Describe what GraphQL-hooks does
- npm i graphql-hooks
- Update the front-end to use ClientProvider
- Write a test component that uses useQuery
- Verify everything is working
- Now C&P the code the renders the list of stories - minus the graphql-hooks logic
- useQuery for the list
- useMutation for the form -> move to a later step...
- Verify that both work / fix people issues
